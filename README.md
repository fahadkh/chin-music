## Chin Music Review

Project for learning some new tech for web dev. Hopefully will also actually be a real website

### Tech - Potential options

Backend: Some js lib?

Frontend: React (hooks!) + typescript, https://reagent-project.github.io/

Communication: gRAphQl

Deploy: TravisCI? AWS/Heroku?

Data Store: Maybe something nosql or easy to do with JS, postgres + index or elasticsearch for indexing/search of tags/album names?
